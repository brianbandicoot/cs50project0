      <h1> About me </h1>
      <p> Hi! My name is Brian Corella. This is my website. Here I am trying my best to learn how to build a professional Webpage
      with the purpose of being able to build others their own. I am a rather average intellectual (if that makes any sense).
      I find myself forgetting everything I was taught in a short while. I have a short attention span and have to focus really
      hard on things. I have to reread most of what I read to actually know what's going on. I guess I have developed a lot of bad
      habits over the years. However, I try to put in my utmost effort into trying to revert those bad habits. But we all know
      old habits die hard. So here I am, in a constant struggle for discipline. It's a very awkward and refreshing battle I must
      say. What I'm trying to say is, most things aren't easy for me. So to make up for my lack of effort, I have to put in a lot
      more effort than someone who does find things (like building a website on html5) easy. </p>
      <p> I have many passions developed over my few years of life. my first passion was probably video games as a kid. But come
        on! Who's first passion as a kid wasn't running around, playing video games and candies? Okay, hear me out. To this day, I am
        in love with video games. The ones that have compelling story telling, great plot and build ups, excellent dynamics to keep
        you interested, and down right fun. I'm not the first nor last "adult" you'll see loving video games.
      </p>
      <p> My next passion is Basketball. It just started out watching the New York Knicks at the time of the early 21st century,
        when they were trash, and it didn't take me long before I started fantisizing about dunking the ball from the free throw line.
        Although I never went pro, (even though it was my dream), I still have my dream of teaching, coaching and developing Basketball
        players at a young age. You could say, running my own basketball team.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I have mentioned before, I have developed a lot of bad habits. Most of them have a pretty big impact on me everyday. One
        of them is my posture. Aesthically, it looks terrible, unattractive and lazy.
      </p>
    </div>
    Here is a list of all my incoming projects.
    <ul>
      <li>Obtain exercise science studies enough to open a gym </li>
      <li>Open a little league basketball school and compete in tournaments</li>
      <li>Help spread plant based diets</li>
      <li>Open an animal shelter </li>
      <li>Include a plant-based restaurant in the gym</li>
    </ul>
