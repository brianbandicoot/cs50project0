    <h3>Fomenting talent with Basketball principles</h3>
    <p class="basketball">Nowadays, the best basketball league in the world, the NBA, is catering so much to it's audience, that it's hurting
    the game. Let me explain. The NBA is a business. Players get paid millions to play and put on a show. And that's it. The key
    word is there: show. Sports Analysts will tell you they're trying to win, and that could be partially true. But really, Players
    are trying to show off, play better for themselves. This is so they can get a multi-million dollar shoe deal or be in
    contention for a max contract. The NBA is less about fundamentals and more about show; flashy dunks and ankle-breaking crossovers.
    This is what the audience wants. Very few of us want to see good, high level basketball. Okay, let's step
    back a minute. These guys are crazy athletic and extremely talented. They spend a whole lot of time in the gym with their
    coaches developing their skills. These guys are supposed to already know all the basketball principles and apply them to
    play at this level. However, very few of this is seen in game. What happens is: the ball needs to get into the hand of the best
    player to create a play. Instead of having fundamentals for opening a space in the defense to score, often times the teams
    have to rely on individual talent to get the team going. So this concept turns into teams trying to get superstars on their
    teams so they can get more money, as stadiums are filled, more jerseys are selling out and ultimately contend. Therefore
    the league becomes superstar-reliant. The more superstars, the more money they make. What was once just a game of Basketball
    has turned into so much more. And for now, its having a negative impact. </p>
